Lesson 1: Variables Explore
<p>In lesson one we developed a mental model for how information is stored and processed by programs shown through variables and decision making. </p>
<h5> What will the value of score be at the end of the program?
“var score
score <- 3
score <- score + 1
score <- "The score is: " + score” 
</h5> 
<h6> The answer is 4 because 3+1 is 4.</h6>
</div> 

  <div id="cfu2u" class="wave">
Lesson 2: Variables Investigate
<p>In lesson two we investigate and modify sample apps that use variables and learn common programming patterns with variables.</p>
<h5>Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work? </h5>
<h6> The counter pattern event works by updating the variable when an "on event" is taking place. </h6>
  </div>

<div id="cfu3u" class="wave">
Lesson 3: Variables Practice
<p>In lesson three we practiced programming with variables through a set of programming puzzles.</p>
<h5>1. What will be displayed after this code segment is run?
“myPoints <- 2
myPoints <- 5
myPoints <- myPoints + 1
display <- myPoints “ 
<br>
2. The program below is run. Which of the following COULD NOT possibly be the output from that program?
“a <- random(1,10)
b <- random(10,20)
display(a)
display(a)
display(b)
display(b)” </h5>
<h6> Answer 1 is, six because 5+1 is 6 since 5 replaces 
<br>
Answer 2 is, 10/5/10/5.</h6>
</div>


<div id="cfu4u" class="wave">
Lesson 4: Variables Make
<p>In lesson four we then started to practice on making an app that uses variables and programming patterns with variables.</p>
<h5>Build the Photo Liker app, using your activity guide to help you plan. </h5>
</div>

<div id="cfu5u" class="wave">
Lesson 5: Conditionals Explore
<p>In lesson five we learned how to develop a mental model for how computers make decisions.</p>
<h5>1. Boolean Expression- Logical Operator- &&- II- !- 
<br>
2. Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?
</h5>
<h6>  Answer 1 is An expression that produces a true or false statement when evaluated.
Logical Operator- A symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions
&&- And
II- Or
!- Not
<br>
Answer 2 is Yes it can, because that would be a Boolean expression, meaning evaluating between something that it's true or not. But it cannot deal with a maybe answer because it’s not a yes or no or false or true. </h6>
</div>

<div id="cfu6" class="wave">
Lesson 6: Conditionals Investigate
<p>In lesson six we Investigated and modified sample apps that use conditionals and learn common programming patterns with conditionals.</p>
<h5>What does it mean to put the most specific case first? Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?</h5>
<h6>It's important to put the most specific case first because the computer reads or evaluates from top to bottom and if the most intense or specific part of the code is anywhere but the top then it could create bugs. </h6>
</div>
  
  <div id="cfu7" class="wave">
Lesson 7: Conditionals Practice
<p>In lesson seven we practiced programming with conditionals through a set of programming puzzles.</p>
<h5>1. What will be displayed after this code segment is run?
score <- 4 
score <- 3 
If lives=0
display "You Lose!"
Else 
If score ≥ 5 and lives = 3
display "Perfect Game"
Else display "You win!" 
<br>
2. The program below asks a user to type in a number and then will output a message. What number will a user need to input for the message "COLD" to be displayed?
number <- INPUT()
IF (number >= 10)
{
  IF (number <= 20)
  {
    DISPLAY("MEDIUM")
  }
  ELSE
  {
    DISPLAY("HOT")
  }
}
ELSE
{
  DISPLAY("COLD")
}</h5>
<h6> The first answer is You Win ! and the second answer is 5. </h6>
  </div>

<div id="cfu8" class="wave">
Lesson 8: Conditionals Make
<p>In lesson eight we practiced making an app that uses conditionals and programming patterns with conditionals.</p>
<h5> Build the Museum Ticket Generator app, using your activity guide to help you plan. </h5>
</div>

<div id="cfu9" class="wave">
Lesson 9: Functions Explore / Investigate
<p>In lesson nine we developed a mental model for using functions to replace repeated code.In addition we investigated and modified sample apps that use functions.</p>
<h5> In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?</h5>
<h6> Creating functions in my code makes my work much easier incase I have to repeat a code, break down a problem, allows me to store code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call or use that code whenever needed in a short command. </h6>
</div>

<div id="cfu10" class="wave">
Lesson 10: Functions Practice
<p>In lesson ten we practiced programming with functions through a set of programming puzzles.</p>
<h5> What will be displayed after this code segment is run?
day_of_week <- "Saturday"
day_of_week <- "Monday"
If day_of_week = "Saturday" OR day_of_week <- "Sunday"
  weekend
  Procedure weekday
  DISPLAY "School day"
  Procedure weekend
  DISPLAY "Day off"
</h5>
<h6> The answer is School day.</h6>
</div>

<div id="cfu11" class="wave">
Lesson 11: Functions Make
<p>In lesson eleven we practiced making an app that uses functions and programming patterns with functions.</p>
<h5> Build the Quote Maker app, using your activity guide to help you plan. </h5>
</div>

<div id="cfu12" class="wave">
Lesson 12,13,14: Project Decision Maker
<p>In lesson 12,13, and 14 we're going to create an app from scratch that uses variables, conditionals, and functions to help a user make a decision.</p>
