      <p> In Design and Web Development we make and design websites/ apps. In which, I'm good at both but will rather debug or design instead of coding from scratch. We've done many projects, all that have to do with CSS, Boostrap, Javascript, AI machine learning, and HTML. I am a very creative person when it comes to my designs and in this portfolio not only will my skills in computer science be shown but as well as my intrests outside of computer science in which I've found ways to connect the two. Websites will be shown as well as apps that have been created by me in this class.</p>

      <p>In here I will be deeply explaining every part of my work that is in my portfolio. In "Read more" you will find a list of all my work with an explanation of each, works that I'm proud of along with projects that I have done that I'm not as proud of. However, the list of all my work that I'm proud of is also posted in "Most Proud Work of Mine" but without an explanation just pictures of all my work that I have done throughout this year in class. </p>

      <h4><b>About Myself</b></h4>
      <p>My name is Nikolle Vizcaya and I am currently a Junior in Thomas A Edison CTE HS learning Design and Web Development. I am Latina born and raised in Venezuela, I came to the United States when I was 8 years old and started doing basic coding in sixth to seventh grade. In my Sophmore year of high school I also studied computer science but with the basics of Word, Slides, and Sheets. Now, this year I've famiralized more with CSS, Boostrap, AI machine learning, and HTML. Outside of Web Development I love literature, art, and sports such as Basketball, Swimming, and Volleyball. That's why for college I'm planning to study Arts such as painting, drawing, and sculptures or Law, majoring probably to be a Judge along with playing college Basketball. On the side of college for work I might do debuging or design jobs. </p>
