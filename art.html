<h1>My opinion </h1>
<p>Sculpture is a beautiful thing. It expresses feelings that words can't describe, that people or even yourself might not even understand. Art in general does that but sculpture itself helps those feelings come to live. You can grab and touch your feelings even if it's not a living thing.  </p>
