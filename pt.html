      <h2 class="text1u">Question 1: </h2>
      <h4 class="text1u"> Answer: The overall purpose of this was to be able to have time management, be able to make codes
        <br>by ourselves due to our ideas for the app, to improve our decision making and debugging skills, 
        <br> and have fun editing our app visually. Doing this gives us experience for web development.
        <br> My app is a social media app called PickYou. My app is not like Instagram or Twitter where all kinds of 
        <br> people and categories are in one place. In my app you have to be older than 14 and live in the USA
        <br> (Input). If you met these requirements you would pick your category Art & fashion or Music & Dance 
        <br> and it  will take you to each separate social media regarding which interest you pick (output).  
        <br> If, younger than 14, live outside of the USA, or both you will be taken to a page denying you 
        <br>to use the app and explaining why (output).

<h2 class="text2u"> Question 2: </h2>
<h4 class="text2u"> Answer:Two different classmates gave me feedback, Tesheni, and Sabbine. 
  <br>They said that I had very good ideas for my app and they liked how it looked visually but coding wise 
  <br>the app wasn't really working. Some buttons weren't working. Sometimes some buttons worked and 
  <br>sometimes they didn't. There was a lot to debug and they specified that perfectly. Their ideas were 
  <br>to focus more on debugging the code so that whoever was using the app could work through it perfectly. 
  <br>So that's what I did. I debugged my code and my code started working. I was able to travel through all 
  <br>the screens I meant to travel to depending on what button I chose. This improved my app because there 
  <br>was no more crashing. However, I believe a "Back to home page" button is needed. The feedback helps you 
  <br>app a lot because you get different point of views from different people and if they give you the same point 
  <br>of view it means that it's a really good and true point they're making.
